  This is done by webscraping popular local supermarkets such as Cold Storage
  
- Users are also able to login, save products and favorite products. These features are implemented with the help of Firebase

- Finally users are also able to purchase the product. When the user clicks on the product he/she will be redirected to the product page and can continue from there.
